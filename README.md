### Hey, my name is Maks <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> !

I'm software engineer and sysadmin. I work at [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/en/) and [Optimizing Technologies](http://www.optimitech.com/index.html). My main line of work is improving of simulators of computer architectures. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is my favorite project. I added some special computer architectures in it. These works were completed in several commercial projects and startup [GONT](https://github.com/gontchain/). All of them are used in companies like internal tools. Also, there is technology QEMU-TLM which allows introduce any emulated peripherals into QEMU. So, I used it for creating some emulators.

Beside, I participate in the development of other system softwares which are usually written on **C**, **Python**, **Bash** and **Go**. E.g., I customized several times gcc-toolchain for some architectures based on **RISC-V**, **MIPS** and I ported gcc-newlib library for processor which is made on **RISC-V**. There are other systems tools which are developed by me, e.g. Linux kernel modules, GUI tools are based on **PyQt**, generators of code and other.  

My admin skills are based on **Linux**, **slurm**, **nfs**, **iptables**, **docker**, **RAID**, **GitLab**, **Jira**, **munin**, **openVPN**, **ftp**, **proxy**, tools and libraries for development of SoC - **TSMC**, **Synopsys**, **Cadence**, **Ansys**.
