### Hey, my name is Maks <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width=35 > !

I'm software engineer, Linux system administrator and DevOps engineer. My main line of work is improving of simulators of computer architectures. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is my favorite project. I added some special computer architectures in it. These works were completed in several commercial projects and startup [GONT](https://github.com/gontchain/). All of them are used in companies like internal tools. Also, there is technology **QEMU-TLM** which allows to make emulators of heterogeneous multiple cores and, of course, to introduce any emulated peripherals into QEMU. So, I used it for creating some emulators.

Beside, I participate in the development of other system softwares which are usually written on **C**, **C++**, **Python** and **Bash**. E.g., I customized several times gcc-toolchain for some architectures based on **RISC-V**, **MIPS** and I ported gcc-newlib library for processor which is made on **RISC-V**. There are other systems tools which are developed by me, e.g. Linux kernel modules, Embedded software for **Xilinx Zynq**, GUI tools are based on **PyQt**, [generators of code](https://github.com/mperov/generatorConstructionsC), Embedded tests of various hardware modules and other.  Also, I have skills to make **installers** for various Linux distributions, e.g. deb-package and [universal sh-installer](https://github.com/mperov/universalInstaller).

My admin skills are based on **Linux**, **nfs**, **iptables**, **docker**, **RAID**, **GitLab**, **Jira**, **munin**, **openVPN**, **VNC**, **ThinLinc**, **Ansible**, **Environment Modules**, tools and libraries for development of SoC - **TSMC**, **Synopsys**, **Cadence**, **Ansys**, **Xilinx**, **Arteris**.
And my favorite distributions of operating systems are **Ubuntu**, **CentOS** and **Debian**.  
Also, I have experience in building of computer clusters which is based on **slurm** and **Grid Engine** (AGE, [SGE](https://github.com/daimh/sge), UGE). These computer clusters are used for EDA, electronic design automation.

In addition, I'm interested in **DevOps**-area. I have expertise in GitLab CI/CD, [Ansible](https://github.com/mperov/ansible-mipt), [Docker](https://github.com/mperov/docker-ubuntu16.04_builder_ergochip-toolchain), Jenkins.
