### Hey, my name is Maskim Perov <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> !

I'm software engineer and sysadmin. I work at [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/en/) and [Optimizing Technologies](http://www.optimitech.com/index.html). My main line of work is improving of simulators of computer architectures. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is my favorite project. I added some special computer architectures in it. These works were completed in several commercial projects and startup [GONT](https://github.com/gontchain/). All of them are used in companies like internal tools.

Beside, I participate in the development of other system softwares which are usually written on **C**, **Python**, **Bash** and **Go**. E.g., I customized gcc-toolchain for some architectures based on **RISC-V**, **MIPS** and I ported newlib gcc library for processor which is made on **RISC-V**.

My admin skills are based on **Linux**, **slurm**, **nfs**, **GitLab**, **Jira**, **munin**, **openVPN**, **ftp**, **proxy**, **iptables**, tools and libraries for development of SoC - **TSMC**, **Synopsys**, **Cadence**, **Ansys**.
